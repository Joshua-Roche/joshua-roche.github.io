                I am Josh, a statistician with a passion for applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in the field of oncology. I am particularly interested in the development of novel tools to improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. I am also interested in the application of deep learning to medical imaging, with a focus on the development of tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tumour segmentation. I am involved in the <a href="https://predictmeso.com/" target="_blank" style ="color:#5e5e5e">Predict-MESO Network</a> which is focused on precision prediction and early treatment of mesothelioma.

            <p style="font-family: Arial; color:#5e5e5e"> 
                I hold a first-class Masters degree in Mathematics from the University of Nottingham, where my academic focus centered on Bayesian inference and computational statistics. During my time at the university, I engaged in several research projects, investigating various topics within the field. These projects included shape analysis, the limits of computation, regularization methods in machine learning, and heart condition prediction from electrocardiograms (ECGs).

                Following my studies, I gained practical experience as a biostatistician in cancer clinical trials, with a particular emphasis on gastrointestinal (GI), ovarian, and brain cancers. Working in this challenging domain allowed me to apply my mathematical expertise to contribute meaningfully to cancer research and treatment. Currently, I hold the position of Lead Statistician for a UK-wide multi-centre, prospective observational study.

                I am also pursuing a Ph.D. in Cancer Sciences at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Glasgow. My doctoral research focuses on the development of a clinical tool aimed at recalibrating the mesothelioma staging system. The aim is to incorporate tumor volume alongside disease invasiveness, aligning it with approaches used in numerous other cancer staging systems. This adjustment will enable a more comprehensive and precise stratification of patients, contributing to improved clinical decision-making. This research showcases my dedication to leveraging advanced technologies, such as deep learning, to address critical challenges in the field of oncology.
